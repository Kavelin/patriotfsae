  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      Formula SAE (FSAE) challenges students to conceive, design, fabricate, and
      compete with small formula-style racing cars. These cars are judged in a
      series of static and dynamic events, including technical inspection, cost,
      presentation, engineering design, solo performance trials, and high
      performance endurance.
