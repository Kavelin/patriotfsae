    <div class="section-content">
      <p>The idea of Patriot Motorsports was born in a student's garage. Since then, it has grown to have its own workshop located at George Mason's Science and Technology campus in Manassas, and is expanding into a new workshop in January 2025. The team was originally only a few students with a dream. Now, our chassis is 80% completed, the engine turns over, the suspension has been created and fabricated, and the control systems and brakes are in development, courtesy of a senior capstone project.</p>
